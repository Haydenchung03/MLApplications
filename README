A (poor) attempt at me trying to learn quantitative modeling, statistics, machine learning, and algorithmic backtesting. 
I am not a professional, and none of my work should be taken in a professional manner. I am just a guy who likes to learn and code.

To get started, set up a virtual machine, activate virtual machine and install the requirements.txt file using:

1. python -m venv venv
2. venv\Scripts\activate
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
